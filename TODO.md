# TODO

## New Code Back-End

* Add support for the revised API, where the lexer produces a triple of a
  token and two positions, and there is no `lexbuf`. (Command-line switch.)

* Add support for the incremental API. (Command-line switch.)

* Investigate adding support for the inspection API. This would likely require
  disabling many optimizations: PUSH movement must be forbidden; all states,
  positions, and semantic values must be represented, for simplicity.

## Automaton

* When displaying the known suffix of the stack in a `.messages` file and/or
  in an `.automaton` file, use the *long* invariant?

## Performance

* Conflict explanation can be very slow when there are many conflicts.
  Can we do something about it?

* In the table back-end, writing a specialized version of `PackedIntArray.get`
  to the generated `.ml` file could allow a performance gain. (Suggested by
  Frédéric Bour.)

## Enhancements

* Add `--strategy none` to guarantee that the `error` token is not used.

* Offer a way of producing a de-lexer (`print_token_concrete`).
  When printing `.messages` files, after each sentence, as part
  of the auto-comments, show this sentence in concrete syntax.
  Note that we already have a mechanism for assigning a concrete syntax
  to a token (namely, token aliases).
  Where else can we print tokens in concrete syntax?
  In conflict explanations?

* It could be interesting to offer a way of producing a set of sentences that
  reach every state where a production that ends with `error` is reduced.
  (Suggested by Gabriel Scherer.) More generally, given an arbitrary
  production, it would be interesting to produce a set of sentences that reach
  every state where this production is reduced.

* Extensions to the incremental API:
    * Propose a new parsing loop that implements one of several error
      handling strategies:
        * recognize the `error` token and treat it as it is treated today;
        * recognize the `error` token and perform reductions on it,
          but do not discard stack cells,
          and after shifting on `error`, stop (without asking for the
          next token);
        * do not recognize the `error` token; perform as many reductions
          as possible, then stop.
        * do not recognize the `error` token; stop immediately.
    * Expose a function `lookahead` of type `'a env -> token option`.
    * Expose `print_checkpoint`.
    * Define a printer for stacks.

* Extensions to the inspection API:
    * Offer a way of mapping an initial state (number) back to its
      nonterminal symbol.
    * Expose the number of states (useful for memoization).
    * Expose the number of productions.
    * Expose an isomorphism between `token` and `xtoken`,
      defined as `exists 'a. ('a terminal * 'a)`.
      The functions `T.token2terminal` and `T.token2value` offer one direction,
      from `token` to `xtoken`. The other direction would have to be generated.

* The inspection API does not allow determining the current state in the
  special case where the stack is empty (which implies that we are in an
  initial state). Could this state be exposed?
  One problem is that `incoming_symbol` would then need to return an `option`.
  The data constructor `Nil` should contain the initial state.
  Beware: applying `items` to this initial state would produce
  the special item `S' -> S #`, creating a problem.
  Should the initial state have a different type?
  Or should we just expose the start symbol, not the start state?

## Minor suggestions for enhancements

* `promote.sh` is currently broken; remove it? Check if Dune can create
  missing files.

* Let `--compare-errors` produce a list of error messages that is sorted
  by location.

* Would it make sense to *not* report conflicts on the `error` token?
  Or to report them but consider them acceptable even in `--strict` mode?
  (I think so. Or maybe distinguish `--strict` and `--strict-except-on-error`.)

* Add a new flag `--show-stdlib` to print `standard.mly`. (Suggested by
  Gabriel Scherer.)

* Allow `%type` declarations to appear in the rule section.

* Allow the generated types (`token`, etc.) to be annotated with OCaml
  attributes such as `[@@deriving show]`.
  The only question is how to request this most elegantly: in the `.mly` file
  (with what syntax?) or via the command line. (Issue #6.)

* Add a command line option to control how `MenhirLib` should be named in the
  generated code. (Suggested by Gabriel Scherer.)

* Allow a rule of the form `foo == bar` as sugar for `foo: bar { $1 }`?
  (Allow parameters. Allow several alternatives on the right-hand side,
  as long as each alternative has length 1.) (Frédéric Bour.)
  (Gabriel Scherer,
   [A suggestion for a more expressive production syntax](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/menhir/2017-05/msg00003.html).)
  (Always parenthesize production groups that share a semantic action?)
  (Or just disallow them?)

* Complete the implementation of `--only-preprocess-for-ocamlyacc`.
  Currently, the position keywords (`$startpos`, etc.) are not supported.
  Translate them to calls to the `Parsing` module.
  Document this command.

* The documentation says not to use `_i`,
  but `--only-preprocess` produces it.
  Should we avoid producing it?
  Should we check that it is not used?

* Allow writing `%token FOO [@unused]`.
  This should be equivalent to passing `--unused-token FOO`
  on the command line.
  Add an analogous mechanism for nonterminal symbols that are known
  to be unreachable.

* Produce well-chosen (predictable) names for anonymous rules?

* Recognize `#` directives in the `.mly` file and take them into account.

* Allow `--trace` mode to use some printing function other than `fprintf
  stderr`. That would allow the programmer to decide at runtime whether
  a trace should be printed, for instance. Also, give users access to
  the function `print_token` that is generated in `--trace` mode?
  (Issue #6.)

* Preserve the directory name in the `#` directives that we emit.
  (Not sure if this is necessary.)

## Installation

* `generate-printers` should not be a demo but a tool, and should be
  installed. That would solve issue #6. Even more convenient would be
  to build its functionality directly into Menhir.

## Minor bugs

* A drawback of point-free semantic actions: if the application of the OCaml
  identifier to the tuple is ill-typed, then we get a type error in the mock
  file. Can this be fixed? Generate `#` directives around the application node.

## Demos

* Clean up the `calc-inspection` demo, which uses an undocumented/unfinished
  approach to error reporting.

## Tests

* Add proper test cases for `--list-errors`.

## Major new features

* Currently we warn about nonterminals that generate the empty language. Could
  we allow this on purpose? If the right-hand side of a production provably
  generates the empty language, we could remove this production, and come back
  to the current setting where every nonterminal symbol is inhabited. The
  point is that this allows defining the empty language by `void: void` and
  using `void` as an actual parameter in parameterized definitions. This
  allows making extensible definitions and instantiating them with "no
  extension". Probably a `%void` annotation would be needed to indicate that a
  symbol is intended to generate an empty language. The symbols that generate
  an empty language should be eliminated before testing for cycles, since
  `void: void` is obviously a cycle.

* Add a facility to produce a set of *valid* sentences that reach *every*
  reachable state of the automaton and exercise *every* reduction. This could
  be useful in regression testing.

* Think about implementing Adams and Might's technique for intersecting a
  grammar with a tree automaton. (As a preprocessing step. Think about the
  interaction with parameterized symbols and with `%inline`.) See also de
  Souza Amorim, Steindorfer & Visser.

* Integrate Frédéric Bour's work on concrete syntax trees.
    * Produce a definition of the specific type of CSTs for this grammar.
      (Before expansion.)
    * Produce a grammar where the semantic actions build CSTs.
    * Define a generic (internal) type of CSTs and
      produce a function that maps generic CSTs to specific CSTs.
    * "Uninliner" : map CSTs for the expanded grammar
      back to CSTs for the source grammar?
    * "Unparsing" : map an arbitrary CST to one that can be printed
      and re-parsed identically, while inserting a minimal number of
      "parentheses". Ideally, with a static guarantee of success,
      and in linear time.

* Allow the user to choose the type of "source code intervals" that are stored
  in the stack (instead of imposing a pair of locations, `$startpos` and
  `$endpos`) and to choose how intervals are combined. See [Frédéric's
  branch](https://gitlab.inria.fr/fpottier/menhir/tree/fred-abstract-locations).
  See also Frédéric's email to François entitled `Menhir avec $loc`
  (2018/07/26).

* Make Menhir truly target-language-independent. Implement support for
  back-ends other than OCaml and Coq. (That would require building the
  lexer modularly, by combining a lexer for Menhir and a lexer for the
  code inside the semantic action brackets.) (That would raise the issue
  of type inference.)

## Documentation

* Document the `.messages` workflow by publishing a tutorial (perhaps a blog
  post). Add build system support (examples of `dune` rules). Try to make
  maintenance easy by offering one command to auto-update a `.messages` file
  and one command to lint a `.messages` file (check for correctness,
  irredundancy, completeness).

* Explain how to simulate inherited attributes
  (cf. post by David Chemouil on the mailing list).

* Document the fact that `yacc` and Menhir do not have the same behavior
  concerning default reductions (one performs the default reduction *before*
  calling the lexer, the other does it the other way around). The difference
  is observable only when the semantic action has a side effect which
  influences the lexer (i.e., only when there is a "lexer hack").

* Document the philosophical difference about conflicts between us and Denny &
  Malloy. They think conflicts are a feature and the state-merging technique
  should preserve the behavior of the automaton even in the presence of
  conflicts. We think conflicts should be avoided and it is ok for
  state-merging to alter the behavior of the automaton in the presence of
  conflicts.

## Code Cleanup

* Ideally, `PartialGrammar` should avoid renaming the parameters of
  a rule, when there is no need to do so. The renamed parameter is
  visible in sort unification error messages and in messages about
  duplicate formal parameters (`test/bad/duplicate-formal.mly`).

* Grep for `artificial dependency` and remove these artificial dependencies.
  Ideally, there should be no implicit (global) state ("the" grammar, "the"
  automaton). The grammar or the automaton should be explicit parameters
  everywhere. That would be a large change, though.

## Standard library

* We currently have only two visibility levels (`%public` means globally
  visible, while no qualifier means file-private). We might wish for more
  structure. We might also wish to have a way of ensuring forward
  compatibility when we add new definitions to the standard library. E.g., we
  might wish to restrict `%public` to indicate that a name is defined at the
  user level and introduce `%root` to indicate that a name is defined at the
  root level. The standard library would use `%root`, and ordinary users would
  be forbidden from using it.

* Add more list forms (left-recursive lists, flexible lists, etc.).

* We might wish to add `epsilon` (which recognizes the empty string and
  produces a unit value), `nil` (which recognizes the empty string and
  produces an empty list), etc. However, they would need to be marked
  `%unreachable` (i.e., do not warn if they are unreachable).

## Bugs

* When a parameterized symbol in the standard library has the same name
  as an unparameterized symbol in the user's file, sort inference fails
  (in spite of the renaming that is announced by Menhir).
  See the symbol `pair` in `leap_ExprParser.mly`.

* Confirm the following bug reports and turn them into gitlab issues.

* Message from Valentin Gatien-Baron (2010/01/09). Is this a known bug with
  `--explain`, i.e., the fact that conflicts in unreachable states cannot be
  explained? Can it be fixed? Should we just avoid reporting and explaining
  conflicts in unreachable states? (One might also wish to remove the states
  that become unreachable during conflict resolution, but that would require
  re-numbering states, which seems painful and desirable.) See `belloeil.mly`.
  See also Adrien Guatto's `reduced_parser.mly`. Also check `parser.mly`, sent
  by Andrej Bauer on 2016/01/21. Once this is issue is fixed, improve the test
  suite to verify that we never have unexplainable conflicts.

* The function `rewind` contains an incorrect comment ("every stack
  description either is definite or contains at least one represented state").
  Find out why it is incorrect. Find out what the implications for `rewind`
  are; does this imply that `rewind` can return `Die` too early?

## Things Not To Do

A series of ideas and remarks that could be in the "to do" list, but on which
we do not intend to act, for now.

* Fix the incompatibility with `yacc` and `bison`. These tools guarantee
  to perform a default reduction without looking ahead at the next
  token, whereas Menhir does not.
  (See messages by Tiphaine Turpin from 2011/08/30 on.)
    * Changing this behavior would involve changing both back-ends.
    * Changing this behavior could break existing Menhir parsers.
      (Make it a command line option.)
    * This affects only people who are doing lexical feedback (lexer hacks).
    * Suggestion by Frédéric Bour: allow annotating a production with `%default`
      to indicate that it should always be a default reduction. (Not sure why
      this helps, though.)
    * Think about end-of-stream conflicts, too.
      If there is a default reduction, there is no end-of-stream conflict.
        (Do we report one at the moment?)
      If there is a conflict, why do we arbitrarily solve it in favor of
      looking ahead (eliminating the reduction on `#`)? What does `ocamlyacc` do?

* Here is an idea inspired by our work with Jacques-Henri Jourdan on parsing
  C11. Allow asserting that the distinction between certain tokens (say, `{A,
  B, C}`) cannot influence which action is chosen. Or (maybe) asserting that
  no reduction can take place when the lookahead symbol is one of `{A, B, C}`.
  The goal is to ensure that a lexer hack is robust, i.e., even if the lexer
  cannot reliably distinguish between `A`, `B`, `C`, this cannot cause the
  parser to become misguided.

* Incompatibility with `ocamlyacc`: Menhir discards the lookahead token when
  entering error mode, whereas `ocamlyacc` doesn't. (Reported by Frédéric Bour.)

* Implement `$0`, `$-1`, etc.
  (Along the lines of Bison. They are a potentially dangerous feature, as
   they allow peeking into the stack, which requires the shape of the stack
   to be known / guessed by the programmer.)
  Propose a named syntax, perhaps `<x> foo: ...`
    where the name `x` is bound to the value in the topmost stack cell.
  Ensure that the mechanism is type-safe.
    (Is `--infer` required?)
    (Requires an analysis so that the shape of the stack is known. The
     existing analysis may be sufficient.)
  Implement it in both back-ends.
  On top of this mechanism, it is easy to implement mid-rule actions (à la Bison).
  On top of that, it should be easy to implement inherited attributes (à la BtYacc).
  However, my impression so far is that the whole thing is of interest
  mainly to people who are doing lexer hacks. Otherwise, it is much easier
  to just parse, produce a tree, and transform the tree afterwards.

* Why does `--canonical --table` consume a huge amount of time on a large
  grammar? (3m57s for ocaml.mly, versus 16s without --table) Display how much
  time is spent compressing tables.

* Explain end-of-stream conflicts, too.

* To assign a priority level to a token without choosing an associativity
  status (`%left`, `%right`, `%nonassoc`), one should be allowed to declare
  `%neutral` and obtain an unspecified associativity status (causing an error
  if this status is ever consulted).

* Since the table back-end does not use the invariant,
  it should be possible to save time, in `--table` mode,
  by not running the analysis in `Invariant`.
  That would require making `Invariant` a functor
  and calling it from the back-ends that need it.
  Or perhaps just running the computation on demand (using lazy)
  but that makes timing more difficult.

* The warning "this production is never reduced" is sound but incomplete.
  See `never_reduced.mly`:

  ```
  a: b B | B {}
  b:         {}
  ```

  where we get a warning that `b -> ` is never reduced, but actually (as a
  consequence) `a -> b B` is never reduced either. Reword the current warning?
  Document the problem? Develop a new warning based on `LRijkstra`?
  By the same token, some states could be unreachable, without us knowing.
  What should we do about it?
  Note that the incremental API may allow reaching some states that `LRijkstra`
  would declare unreachable, so, be careful.

* Implementing `may_reduce` by looping over the action table may be too
  conservative? There may be situations where there is no reduce action
  in the table (because they were killed off by conflict resolution) yet
  this state is still capable of reducing this production.
