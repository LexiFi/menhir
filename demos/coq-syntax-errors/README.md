This is a toy demo of the Coq backend of `menhir` that also uses the error messaging functionality. It takes input in the form of a file name on the command line.

Build with `make`. Run the provided tests with `make test` or simply `make` followed by `./test.sh`. 

It is based on `demos/coq-minicalc` and `demos/calc-syntax-errors`.
