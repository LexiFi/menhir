(** [Refine] computes the refined partition of a list of overlapping set: the
    smallest list of non-overlapping sets such that each set is a subset of one
    of the input set.

    This is useful when computing the set of transitions of a DFA when the
    alphabet is large: rather than representing a transition for each letter
    separately, we group them by subset having the same destination.

      Sets in the list guaranteed to be sorted by [compare_minimum] and, if it
      existed, by [compare_maximum].

      That is:
      - each set [s_i] is a subset of the interval
          [minimum s_i .. maximum s_i],

      [s1_head] is made of elements of [s1] that are strictly smaller than any
      element in [s2] and [s1_tail] is made of other elements.
