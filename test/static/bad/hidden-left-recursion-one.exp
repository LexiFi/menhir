File "hidden-left-recursion-one.mly", line 25, characters 2-7:
Error: the grammar exhibits hidden left recursion: in the production
s -> a s C,
the nonterminal symbol a is nullable,
and the remainder of the right-hand side expands to a sentential form
that begins with the nonterminal symbol s.
This implies that the grammar is not LR(k) for any k.
