** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 516.
** Token involved: KWelse
** This state is reached from program after reading:

KWif Llparen expression Lrparen KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

source_elements Leof

statement 
if_statement 
(?)

** In state 516, looking ahead at KWelse, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement KWelse statement 
                                if_statement 
                                KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement . KWelse statement 

** In state 516, looking ahead at KWelse, reducing production
** if_statement -> KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement KWelse statement // lookahead token appears
                                if_statement // lookahead token is inherited
                                KWif Llparen expression Lrparen statement .
