State 0 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production liste(A) -> 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of C B A,
which would require some other action.

State 1 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production liste(A) -> 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of C B A,
which would require some other action.

State 2 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production liste(A) -> A liste(A)
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of C B,
which would require some other action.

State 4 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between

State 5 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
