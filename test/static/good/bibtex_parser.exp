Built an LR(0) automaton with 34 states.
The grammar is SLR(1).
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 47 states.
21 out of 47 states have a default reduction.
11 out of 47 states are represented.
0 out of 25 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 25 symbols keep track of their end position.
13 out of 21 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
0 out of 47 states can peek at an error.
130 functions before inlining, 21 functions after inlining.
