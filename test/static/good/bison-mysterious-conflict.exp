Built an LR(0) automaton with 19 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 1 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 20 states.
9 out of 20 states have a default reduction.
5 out of 20 states are represented.
0 out of 12 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 12 symbols keep track of their end position.
6 out of 10 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
41 functions before inlining, 10 functions after inlining.
