** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 305.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from translation_unit after reading:

declarator LBRACE IF LPAREN expression RPAREN IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement 

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

translation_unit 
external_declaration 
function_definition 
declarator compound_statement 
           LBRACE statement_list RBRACE 
                  statement 
                  selection_statement 
                  (?)

** In state 305, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production
** selection_statement -> IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement 
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement ELSE statement // lookahead token appears
                            selection_statement // lookahead token is inherited
                            IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement . 

** In state 305, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement 
                            selection_statement 
                            IF LPAREN expression RPAREN statement . ELSE statement
