Built an LR(0) automaton with 40 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 4 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 40 states.
16 shift/reduce conflicts were silently solved.
13 out of 40 states have a default reduction.
12 out of 40 states are represented.
0 out of 26 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 26 symbols keep track of their end position.
11 out of 20 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
0 out of 40 states can peek at an error.
114 functions before inlining, 24 functions after inlining.
