Built an LR(0) automaton with 30 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 2 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 30 states.
2 shift/reduce conflicts were silently solved.
10 out of 30 states have a default reduction.
8 out of 30 states are represented.
0 out of 19 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 19 symbols keep track of their end position.
7 out of 15 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
56 functions before inlining, 11 functions after inlining.
