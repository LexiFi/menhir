** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: L_BRACKET
** This state is reached from goal after reading:

left_hand_side ASSIGN expression 

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

goal 
assignment EOF 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at L_BRACKET, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

left_hand_side ASSIGN expression 
                      primary 
                      array_access 
                      expression . L_BRACKET primary_not_name R_BRACKET 

** In state 8, looking ahead at L_BRACKET, reducing production
** assignment -> left_hand_side ASSIGN expression 
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

left_hand_side ASSIGN expression 
primary_not_name 
array_access 
expression L_BRACKET primary_not_name R_BRACKET // lookahead token appears
assignment // lookahead token is inherited
left_hand_side ASSIGN expression .
