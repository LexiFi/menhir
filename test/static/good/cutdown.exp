Built an LR(0) automaton with 20 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 3 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 21 states.
Warning: one state has shift/reduce conflicts.
Warning: one shift/reduce conflict was arbitrarily resolved.
8 out of 21 states have a default reduction.
