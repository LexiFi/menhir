Built an LR(0) automaton with 20 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 3 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 21 states.
Warning: one state has shift/reduce conflicts.
Warning: one shift/reduce conflict was arbitrarily resolved.
8 out of 21 states have a default reduction.
4 out of 21 states are represented.
0 out of 16 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 16 symbols keep track of their end position.
6 out of 11 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
43 functions before inlining, 12 functions after inlining.
