State 0 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production stanzas -> 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of FIELD EOL,
which would require some other action.

State 2 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production field -> FIELD EOL
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of FIELD EOL EOF CONT,
which would require some other action.

State 4 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production linecont -> CONT EOL
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of FIELD EOL EOF CONT,
which would require some other action.

State 5 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production linecont -> CONT EOL linecont
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of FIELD EOL EOF,
which would require some other action.

State 6 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production field -> FIELD EOL linecont
