** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 58.
** Token involved: DOT
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

classDecs COLON LPAREN ID RPAREN termDef

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
classDecs COLON termDef 
                (?)

** In state 58, looking ahead at DOT, reducing production
** TmCastDef -> LPAREN ID RPAREN termDef
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

TmFieldAccessDef 
termDef DOT ID // lookahead token appears
TmCastDef // lookahead token is inherited
LPAREN ID RPAREN termDef . 

** In state 58, looking ahead at DOT, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

TmCastDef 
LPAREN ID RPAREN termDef 
                 TmFieldAccessDef 
                 termDef . DOT ID
