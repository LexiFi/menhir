State 1 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production exp -> INT 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TIMES PLUS,
which would require some other action.

State 2 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) accepting exp
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TIMES PLUS,
which would require some other action.

State 4 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production exp -> exp TIMES exp 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TIMES PLUS,
which would require some other action.

State 6 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production exp -> exp PLUS exp 
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TIMES PLUS,
which would require some other action.
