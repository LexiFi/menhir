State 1 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production t -> N
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of RPAR MINUS,
which would require some other action.

State 3 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production e -> t
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of RPAR MINUS,
which would require some other action.

State 5 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production t -> LPAR e RPAR
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of RPAR MINUS,
which would require some other action.

State 7 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production e -> e MINUS t
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of RPAR MINUS,
which would require some other action.

State 9 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production s -> e
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is MINUS,
which would require some other action.
