State 0:
dummy' -> . dummy [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 1
-- On dummy shift to state 5

State 1:
dummy -> A . [ # ]
dummy -> A . infinite [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 2
-- On infinite shift to state 4
-- On # reduce production dummy -> A
** End-of-stream conflict on A
**   There is a tension between
**   (1) reducing production dummy -> A
**   without even requesting a lookahead token, and
**   (2) testing whether the lookahead token is a member of the above set.

State 2:
infinite -> A . infinite [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 2
-- On infinite shift to state 3

State 3:
infinite -> A infinite . [ # ]
-- On # reduce production infinite -> A infinite

State 4:
dummy -> A infinite . [ # ]
-- On # reduce production dummy -> A infinite

State 5:
dummy' -> dummy . [ # ]
-- On # accept dummy
