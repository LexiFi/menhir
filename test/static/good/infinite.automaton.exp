State 0:
dummy' -> . dummy [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 1
-- On dummy shift to state 5

State 1:
dummy -> A . [ # ]
dummy -> A . infinite [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 2
-- On infinite shift to state 4
-- On # reduce production dummy -> A

State 2:
infinite -> A . infinite [ # ]
-- On A shift to state 2
-- On infinite shift to state 3

State 3:
infinite -> A infinite . [ # ]
-- On # reduce production infinite -> A infinite

State 4:
dummy -> A infinite . [ # ]
-- On # reduce production dummy -> A infinite

State 5:
dummy' -> dummy . [ # ]
-- On # accept dummy

State 1 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production dummy -> A
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is A,
which would require some other action.
