Built an LR(0) automaton with 13 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 1 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 13 states.
One shift/reduce conflict was silently solved.
5 out of 13 states have a default reduction.
3 out of 13 states are represented.
0 out of 13 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 13 symbols keep track of their end position.
4 out of 6 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
26 functions before inlining, 5 functions after inlining.
