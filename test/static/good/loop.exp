Built an LR(0) automaton with 8 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 2 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 8 states.
2 shift/reduce conflicts were silently solved.
Only 7 states remain after resolving shift/reduce conflicts.

Warning: production s -> B is never reduced.
Warning: in total, 1 production is never reduced.
5 out of 7 states have a default reduction.
2 out of 7 states are represented.
0 out of 9 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 9 symbols keep track of their end position.
4 out of 5 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
18 functions before inlining, 2 functions after inlining.
