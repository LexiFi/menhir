State 1 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production expression -> TRUE
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of THEN ELSE,
which would require some other action.

State 3 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production expression -> FALSE
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of THEN ELSE,
which would require some other action.

State 6 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production expression -> IF expression THEN expression
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of THEN ELSE,
which would require some other action.

State 8 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production expression -> IF expression THEN expression ELSE expression
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of THEN ELSE,
which would require some other action.
