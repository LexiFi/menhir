** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 6.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from expression after reading:

IF expression THEN IF expression THEN expression

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

expression 
(?)

** In state 6, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production
** expression -> IF expression THEN expression
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expression THEN expression ELSE expression // lookahead token appears
                   IF expression THEN expression . 

** In state 6, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expression THEN expression 
                   IF expression THEN expression . ELSE expression
