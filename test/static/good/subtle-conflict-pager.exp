Built an LR(0) automaton with 16 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 1 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 16 states.
One shift/reduce conflict was silently solved.
Only 15 states remain after resolving shift/reduce conflicts.

Warning: production a -> A B is never reduced.
Warning: in total, 1 production is never reduced.
8 out of 15 states have a default reduction.
2 out of 15 states are represented.
0 out of 14 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 14 symbols keep track of their end position.
9 out of 9 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
32 functions before inlining, 4 functions after inlining.
