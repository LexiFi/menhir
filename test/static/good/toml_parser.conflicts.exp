** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 34.
** Token involved: ARRAY_END
** This state is reached from toml_ast after reading:

list(NEWLINE) table_path EQ ARRAY_START

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toml_ast 
list(NEWLINE) table EOF 
              items_on_lines(table_entry)

** In state 34, looking ahead at ARRAY_END, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

ARRAY_START . ARRAY_END 

** In state 34, looking ahead at ARRAY_END, reducing production
** item_sequence(COMMA,value) ->
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

ARRAY_START item_sequence(COMMA,value) ARRAY_END // lookahead token appears
            .
