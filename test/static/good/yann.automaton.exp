State 2 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production fa1 -> INT
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TIMES RPAREN PLUS,
which would require some other action.

State 5 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production fa4 -> MATRIX
without even requesting a lookahead token, and
(2) checking whether the lookahead token is one of TENSOR RPAREN PLUS,
which would require some other action.

State 7 has an end-of-stream conflict. There is a tension between
(1) reducing production term -> product
