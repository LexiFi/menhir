** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 13.
** Tokens involved: RPAREN PLUS #
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from exp after reading:

term PLUS tensorproduct 

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

exp 
term 
term PLUS product // lookahead token appears

** In state 13, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production
** term -> term PLUS tensorproduct 
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

term PLUS tensorproduct .
