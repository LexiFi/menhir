Built an LR(0) automaton with 24 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 2 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 25 states.
Warning: 2 states have reduce/reduce conflicts.
Warning: 6 reduce/reduce conflicts were arbitrarily resolved.
Warning: 13 end-of-stream conflicts were arbitrarily resolved.
