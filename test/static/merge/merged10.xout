main: LPAREN INT LPAREN

# We have an expression on the stack at offset 0,
# and an opening parenthesis at offset 1.

I have read an opening parenthesis,
followed with the expression '$0'.
I am now expecting either an arithmetic operator or a closing parenthesis.

main: INT RPAREN

# We have an expression on the stack at offset 0.

I have read the expression '$0'.
I am now expecting either an arithmetic operator or the end of the input.
